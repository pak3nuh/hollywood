# Hollywood

A minimalistic type safe actor based framework built with and for kotlin.

This project leverages several technologies to provide an easier way to handle concurrent programing. It does not intend to be fully compliant with all the requirements of the actor model, just borrows some of it's main ideas.

**Disclaimer: Just a PoC at this stage**
